# Build Static Binaries for *urunc*-Supported Monitors

This repository provides a reference setup for building and distributing static
binaries of monitors and tools supported by
[**urunc**](https://github.com/urunc-dev/urunc).

## Supported Monitors and Tools

The following components are currently supported:

- [**QEMU**](https://www.qemu.org/)
- [**Firecracker**](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/)
- [**Solo5**](https://github.com/Solo5/solo5)
- [**virtiofsd**](https://gitlab.com/virtio-fs/virtiofsd)

## Artifact Packaging

Each component is built using the version specified in the `VERSION` file
located in its respective directory. The resulting binaries are packaged into a
single tar archive, which can be downloaded from the repository’s **Releases**
page.

## Release Naming Scheme

Releases follow this naming format:

```
FC-<firecracker_version>_S5-<solo5_version>_VFS-<virtiofsd_version>_QM-<qemu_version>-<qemu_config_and_exclude_files_hash>
```

For example `FC-v1.7.0_S5-v0.9.3_VFS_-v1.13.1_QM-v10.1.1-d4dd3` contains
statically built artifacts for:
- Firecracker v1.7.0
- Solo5 v0.9.3
- Virtiofsd v1.13.1
- Qemu v10.1.1 with a hash generated by the config files and the excluded files
  file under Qemu's directory.
